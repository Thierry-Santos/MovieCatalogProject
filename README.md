# MovieCatalogProject

#### a. How do you intend to approach this project? What technologies have you decided to use for each part?

 - It's a small project with a few needs, so it can be focused on having a considerable amount of tests and good and clean interface. I decided to use React.js for the Front-end and Node.js for Back-end, keeping it simple using hooks and material-UI with React.js, express with Node.js and Jest for tests on both, simple architecture and clean code.

#### b. Do you find this to be particularly challenging in any of its requirements?

 - In some ways yes, because I challenge myself on every project even if it's a small one.

#### c. If you had a lot of time to do this, what would you do differently?

 - If I had more time... I would use a database(Postgres) to have a consistent structure, docker just to make everything easier and would develop an app using React-Native to create more accessibility for users.
